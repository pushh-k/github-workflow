# GitHub Workflow Assignment

This repository serves as a practical exercise for understanding and implementing a professional GitHub workflow, specifically focusing on direct contributions to the `main` branch with clear, atomic commit messages.

## Assignment Purpose

The primary goal of this assignment is to build muscle memory around efficient Git and GitHub usage, ensuring a clean and understandable project history. It emphasizes structured and intentional pushing to the `main` branch, which is crucial for solo projects or small team collaborations.

## What Was Built

For this assignment, I created a new GitHub repository named `github-workflow`. I then cloned it to my local machine and made several meaningful changes to the `README.md` file. Each change was committed with a clear, descriptive, and human-readable message, and pushed directly to the `main` branch.

The final result is a repository with:

* A single `main` branch.

* An updated `README.md` file.

* A tidy commit history reflecting atomic, well-described changes.

* No extra branches or pull requests, adhering to the assignment constraints.

## Success Tips & Learnings

* **Meaningful Commit Messages:** Always use messages that clearly describe the "what" and "why" of the changes. This makes the project history easy to follow for anyone (including future self!).

* **Small, Focused Commits:** Keep commits atomic. Each commit should ideally address a single logical change or feature. This makes debugging and reverting changes much simpler.

* **Review Changes Before Pushing:** Before running `git push`, it's good practice to review changes with `git status` and `git diff`. This helps catch unintended changes and reinforces good version control habits.
